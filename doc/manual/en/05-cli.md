# Command line interface

The **pgmoneta-cli** command line interface controls your interaction with **pgmoneta**.

**It is important that you only use the pgmoneta-cli command line interface to operate on your backup directory**

Using other commands on the backup directory could cause problems.

## backup

Backup a server

The command for a full backup is

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli backup <server>
```

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli backup primary
```

The command for an incremental backup is

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli backup <server> <identifier>
```

where the `identifier` is the identifier for a backup.

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli backup primary 20250101120000
```

## list-backup

List the backups for a server

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli list-backup <server> [--sort asc|desc]
```

The `--sort` option allows sorting backups by timestamp:
- `asc` for ascending order (oldest first)
- `desc` for descending order (newest first)

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli list-backup primary
```

Example with sorting

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli list-backup primary --sort desc
```

## restore

Restore a backup from a server

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli restore <server> [<timestamp>|oldest|newest] [[current|name=X|xid=X|lsn=X|time=X|inclusive=X|timeline=X|action=X|primary|replica],*] <directory>
```

where

* `current` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to first stable checkpoint
* `name=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the label specified
* `xid=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the XID specified
* `time=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the timestamp specified
* `lsn=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the Log Sequence Number (LSN) specified
* `inclusive=X` means that the restore is inclusive of the specified information
* `timeline=X` means that the restore is done to the specified information timeline
* `action=X` means which action should be executed after the restore (pause, shutdown)

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli restore primary newest name=MyLabel,primary /tmp
```

## verify

Verify a backup from a server

Command

``` sh

```

## archive

Archive a backup from a server

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli archive <server> [<timestamp>|oldest|newest] [[current|name=X|xid=X|lsn=X|time=X|inclusive=X|timeline=X|action=X|primary|replica],*] <directory>
```

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli archive primary newest current /tmp
```

## delete

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli delete <server> [<timestamp>|oldest|newest]
```

Example

``` sh

```

## retain

Retain a backup from a server. The backup will not be deleted by the retention policy

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli retain [--cascade] <server> [<timestamp>|oldest|newest]
```

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli retain primary oldest
```

## expunge

Expunge a backup from a server. The backup will be deleted by the retention policy

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli expunge [--cascade] <server> [<timestamp>|oldest|newest]
```

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli expunge primary oldest
```

## encrypt

Encrypt the file in place, remove unencrypted file after successful encryption.

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli encrypt <file>
```

## decrypt

Decrypt the file in place, remove encrypted file after successful decryption.

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli decrypt <file>
```

## compress

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli compress <file>
```

## decompress

Decompress the file in place, remove compressed file after successful decompression.

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli decompress <file>
```

## info

Information about a backup.

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli info <server> <timestamp|oldest|newest>
```

## ping

Verify if [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] is alive

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli ping
```

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli ping
```
## mode

[**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] detects when a server is down. You can bring a server online or offline
using the mode command.

Command

```
pgmoneta-cli mode <server> <online|offline>
```

Example

```
pgmoneta-cli mode primary offline
```

or

```
pgmoneta-cli mode primary online
```

[**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] will keep basic services running for an offline server such that
you can verify a backup or do a restore.

## shutdown

Shutdown [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta]

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli shutdown
```

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli shutdown
```

## status

Status of [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta], with a `details` option

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli status [details]
```

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli status details
```

## conf

Manage the configuration

Command

```sh
pgmoneta-cli conf [reload | ls | get | set]
```

Subcommand

- `reload`: Reload configuration
- `ls` : To print the configurations used
- `get <config_key>` : To obtain information about a runtime configuration value
- `set <config_key> <config_value>` : To modify the runtime configuration value

Example

```sh
pgmoneta-cli conf reload
pgmoneta-cli conf ls
pgmoneta-cli conf get server.primary.host
pgmoneta-cli conf set encryption aes-256-cbc
```
**conf get**

Get the value of a runtime configuration key, or the entire configuration.

- If you provide a `<config_key>`, you get the value for that key.
  - For main section keys, you can use either just the key (e.g., `host`) or with the section (e.g., `pgmoneta.host`).
  - For server section keys, use the server name as the section (e.g., `server.primary.host`, `server.myserver.port`).
- If you run `pgmoneta-cli conf get` without any key, the complete configuration will be output.

Examples

```sh
pgmoneta-cli conf get
pgmoneta-cli conf get host
pgmoneta-cli conf get pgmoneta.host
pgmoneta-cli conf get server.primary.host
pgmoneta-cli conf get server.myserver.port
```
`
**conf set**

Set the value of a runtime configuration parameter.

**Syntax:**
```sh
pgmoneta-cli conf set <config_key> <config_value>
```

Examples

```sh
# Logging and monitoring
pgmoneta-cli conf set log_level debug5
pgmoneta-cli conf set metrics 5001
pgmoneta-cli conf set management 5002

# Performance tuning
pgmoneta-cli conf set workers 4
pgmoneta-cli conf set backup_max_rate 1000000
pgmoneta-cli conf set compression zstd

# Retention policies
pgmoneta-cli conf set retention "14,2,6,1"
```

**Key Formats:**
- **Main section parameters**: `key` or `pgmoneta.key`
  - Examples: `log_level`, `pgmoneta.metrics`
- **Server section parameters**: `server.server_name.key` only
  - Examples: `server.primary.port`, `server.primary.host`

**Important Notes:**
- Setting `metrics=0` or `management=0` disables those services
- Invalid port numbers may show success but cause service failures (check server logs)
- Server configuration uses format `server.name.parameter` (not `name.parameter`)

**Response Types:**
- **Success (Applied)**: Configuration change applied to running instance immediately
- **Success (Restart Required)**: Configuration change validated but requires manual update of configuration files AND restart
- **Error**: Invalid key format, validation failure, or other errors

**Important: Restart Required Changes**
When a configuration change requires restart, the change is only validated and stored temporarily in memory. To make the change permanent:

1. **Manually edit the configuration file** (e.g., `/etc/pgmoneta/pgmoneta.conf`)
3. **Restart pgmoneta** using `systemctl restart pgmoneta` or equivalent

**Warning:** Simply restarting pgmoneta without updating the configuration files will **revert** the change back to the file-based configuration.

**Example of Restart Required Process:**
```sh
# 1. Attempt to change host (requires restart)
pgmoneta-cli conf set host 192.168.1.100
# Output: Configuration change requires manual restart
#         Current value: localhost (unchanged in running instance)
#         Requested value: 192.168.1.100 (cannot be applied to live instance)

# 2. Manually edit /etc/pgmoneta/pgmoneta.conf
sudo nano /etc/pgmoneta/pgmoneta.conf
# Change: host = localhost
# To:     host = 192.168.1.100

# 3. Restart pgmoneta
sudo systemctl restart pgmoneta

# 4. Verify the change
pgmoneta-cli conf get host
# Output: 192.168.1.100
```

**Why Manual File Editing is Required:**
- `pgmoneta-cli conf set` only validates and temporarily stores restart-required changes
- Configuration files are **not automatically updated** by the command
- On restart, pgmoneta always reads from the configuration files on disk
- Without file updates, restart will revert to the original file-based values


## clear

Clear data/statistics

Command

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli clear [prometheus]
```

Subcommand

- `prometheus`: Reset the Prometheus statistics

Example

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli clear prometheus
```

## Shell completions

There is a minimal shell completion support for `pgmoneta-cli`.

Please refer to the manual for detailed information about how to enable and use shell completions.
