## 64-bit Transaction IDs (XID64)

pgmoneta fully supports PostgreSQL clusters operating with 64-bit Transaction IDs (FullTransactionId). This ensures long-term compatibility for databases with high transaction volumes that exceed the traditional 32-bit limit (4 billion transactions).

pgmoneta automatically detects 64-bit XIDs during:
* **Streaming:** Capturing the correct epoch and transaction ID during backup operations.
* **WAL Analysis:** Tools like `pgmoneta-walinfo` will display transaction IDs in the `Epoch:XID` format (e.g., `2:1003`) when the counter exceeds 32 bits.
* **Restoration:** Ensuring consistency is maintained even if the database has wrapped around the transaction counter multiple times.

No special configuration is required to enable this support; it is handled automatically based on the PostgreSQL version detected.
