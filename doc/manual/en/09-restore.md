# Restore

## Restore a backup

We can restore a backup from the primary with the following command

```
pgmoneta-cli restore primary newest current /tmp
```

where

* `current` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to first stable checkpoint
* `name=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the label specified
* `xid=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the XID specified
* `time=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the timestamp specified
* `lsn=X` means copy the Write-Ahead Log (WAL ), and restore to the Log Sequence Number (LSN) specified
* `inclusive=X` means that the restore is inclusive of the specified information
* `timeline=X` means that the restore is done to the specified information timeline
* `action=X` means which action should be executed after the restore (pause, shutdown)
* `primary` means that the cluster is setup as a primary
* `replica` means that the cluster is setup as a replica

This command take the latest backup and all Write-Ahead Log (WAL) segments and restore it into the `/tmp/primary-20240928065644` directory for an up-to-date copy.

## Hot standby

In order to use hot standby, simply add

```
hot_standby = /your/local/hot/standby/directory
```

to the corresponding server section of `pgmoneta.conf`. [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] will create the directory if it doesn't exist,
and keep the latest backup in the defined directory.

You can also configure muptiple hot standby directories (up to 8) by providing comma-separated paths:
```
/path/to/hot/standby1,/path/to/hot/standby2,/path/to/hot/standby3
```
[**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] will maintain identical copies of the hot standby in all specified directories.

You can use

```
hot_standby_overrides = /your/local/hot/standby/overrides/
```

to override files in the `hot_standby` directories. The overrides will be applied to all hot_standby directories.

### Tablespaces

By default tablespaces will be mapped to a similar path than the original one, for example `/tmp/mytblspc` becomes `/tmp/mytblspchs`.

However, you can use the directory name to map it to another directory, like

```
hot_standby_tablespaces = /tmp/mytblspc->/tmp/mybcktblspc
```

You can also use the `OID` for the key part, like

```
hot_standby_tablespaces = 16392->/tmp/mybcktblspc
```

Multiple tablespaces can be specified using a `,` between them.
