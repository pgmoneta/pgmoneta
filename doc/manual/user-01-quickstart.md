```

If you encounter any issues following the above steps, you can refer to the **Installation** chapter to see how to install or compile pgmoneta on your system.

## Configuration

Lets create a simple configuration file called `pgmoneta.conf` with the content

``` ini
[pgmoneta]
host = *
metrics = 5001

base_dir = /home/pgmoneta

compression = zstd

retention = 7

log_type = file
log_level = info
log_path = /tmp/pgmoneta.log

unix_socket_dir = /tmp/

[primary]
host = localhost
port = 5432
user = repl
wal_slot = repl
```

In our main section called `[pgmoneta]` we setup [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] to listen on all network addresses. We will enable Prometheus metrics on port 5001 and have the backups live in the `/home/pgmoneta` directory. All backups are being compressed with zstd and kept for 7 days. Logging will be performed at `info` level and put in a file called `/tmp/pgmoneta.log`. Last we specify the location of the `unix_socket_dir` used for management operations and the path for the PostgreSQL command line tools.

Next we create a section called `[primary]` which has the information about our [PostgreSQL][postgresql] instance. In this case it is running on `localhost` on port `5432` and we will use the `repl` user account to connect, and the Write+Ahead slot will be named `repl` as well.

The `repl` user must have the `REPLICATION` role and have access to the `postgres` database,
so for example

``` sh
CREATE ROLE repl WITH LOGIN REPLICATION PASSWORD 'secretpassword';
```

and in `pg_hba.conf`

``` ini
local   postgres       repl                     scram-sha-256
host    postgres       repl    127.0.0.1/32     scram-sha-256
host    postgres       repl    ::1/128          scram-sha-256
host    replication    repl    127.0.0.1/32     scram-sha-256
host    replication    repl    ::1/128          scram-sha-256
```

The authentication type should be based on `postgresql.conf`'s `password_encryption` value.

Then, create a physical replication slot that will be used for Write-Ahead Log streaming, like

``` sh
SELECT pg_create_physical_replication_slot('repl', true, false);
```

Alternatively, configure automatically slot creation by adding `create_slot = yes` to `[pgmoneta]` or corresponding server section.

We will need a user vault for the `repl` account, so the following commands will add a master key, and the `repl` password. The master key should be longer than 8 characters.

``` sh
pgmoneta-admin master-key
pgmoneta-admin -f pgmoneta_users.conf user add
```

For scripted use, the master key and user password can be provided using the `PGMONETA_PASSWORD` environment variable.

We are now ready to run [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta].

See the **Configuration** charpter for all configuration options.

## Running

We will run [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] using the command

``` sh
pgmoneta -c pgmoneta.conf -u pgmoneta_users.conf
```

If this doesn't give an error, then we are ready to do backups.

[**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] is stopped by pressing Ctrl-C (`^C`) in the console where you started it, or by sending the `SIGTERM` signal to the process using `kill <pid>`.

## Run-time administration

[**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] has a run-time administration tool called `pgmoneta-cli`.

You can see the commands it supports by using `pgmoneta-cli -?` which will give

``` console
pgmoneta-cli 0.12.0
  Command line utility for pgmoneta

Usage:
  pgmoneta-cli [ -c CONFIG_FILE ] [ COMMAND ]

Options:
  -c, --config CONFIG_FILE                        Set the path to the pgmoneta.conf file
  -h, --host HOST                                 Set the host name
  -p, --port PORT                                 Set the port number
  -U, --user USERNAME                             Set the user name
  -P, --password PASSWORD                         Set the password
  -L, --logfile FILE                              Set the log file
  -v, --verbose                                   Output text string of result
  -V, --version                                   Display version information
  -F, --format text|json|raw                      Set the output format
  -C, --compress none|gz|zstd|lz4|bz2             Compress the wire protocol
  -E, --encrypt none|aes|aes256|aes192|aes128     Encrypt the wire protocol
  -?, --help                                      Display help

Commands:
  backup                   Backup a server
  list-backup              List the backups for a server
  restore                  Restore a backup from a server
  verify                   Verify a backup from a server
  archive                  Archive a backup from a server
  delete                   Delete a backup from a server
  retain                   Retain a backup from a server
  expunge                  Expunge a backup from a server
  encrypt                  Encrypt a file using master-key
  decrypt                  Decrypt a file using master-key
  ping                     Check if pgmoneta is alive
  shutdown                 Shutdown pgmoneta
  status [details]         Status of pgmoneta, with optional details
  conf <action>            Manage the configuration, with one of subcommands:
                           - 'reload' to reload the configuration
  clear <what>             Clear data, with:
                           - 'prometheus' to reset the Prometheus statistics
```

This tool can be used on the machine running [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] to do a backup like

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf backup primary
```

A restore would be

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf restore primary <timestamp> /path/to/restore
```

To shutdown pgmoneta you would use

``` sh
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf shutdown
```

Check the outcome of the operations by verifying the exit code, like

``` sh
echo $?
```

or by using the `-v` flag.

If pgmoneta has both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and `management` enabled then `pgmoneta-cli` can connect with TLS using the files `~/.pgmoneta/pgmoneta.key` (must be 0600 permission), `~/.pgmoneta/pgmoneta.crt` and `~/.pgmoneta/root.crt`.

## Administration

[**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta] has an administration tool called `pgmoneta-admin`, which is used to control user registration with [**pgmoneta**][pgmoneta].

You can see the commands it supports by using `pgmoneta-admin -?` which will give

``` console
pgmoneta-admin 0.12.0
  Administration utility for pgmoneta

Usage:
  pgmoneta-admin [ -f FILE ] [ COMMAND ]

Options:
  -f, --file FILE         Set the path to a user file
  -U, --user USER         Set the user name
  -P, --password PASSWORD Set the password for the user
  -g, --generate          Generate a password
  -l, --length            Password length
  -V, --version           Display version information
  -?, --help              Display help

Commands:
  master-key              Create or update the master key
  user <subcommand>       Manage a specific user, where <subcommand> can be
                          - add  to add a new user
                          - del  to remove an existing user
                          - edit to change the password for an existing user
                          - ls   to list all available users

```

In order to set the master key for all users you can use

``` sh
pgmoneta-admin -g master-key
```

The master key must be at least 8 characters.

Then use the other commands to add, update, remove or list the current user names, f.ex.

``` sh
pgmoneta-admin -f pgmoneta_users.conf user add
```

## Next Steps

Next steps in improving pgmoneta's configuration could be

* Update `pgmoneta.conf` with the required settings for your system
* Enable Transport Layer Security v1.2+ (TLS) for administrator access

See [Configuration][configuration] for more information on these subjects.
