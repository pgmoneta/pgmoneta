Main configuration file for pgmoneta
------------------------------------

:Manual section: 5

DESCRIPTION
===========

pgmoneta.conf is the main configuration file for pgmoneta.

The file is split into different sections specified by the ``[`` and ``]`` characters. The main section is called ``[pgmoneta]``.

Other sections specifies the PostgreSQL server configuration.

All properties are in the format ``key = value``.

The characters ``#`` and ``;`` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.
The ``Bool`` data type supports the following values: ``on``, ``1``, ``true``, ``off``, ``0`` and ``false``.

OPTIONS
=======

  The base directory for the backup. Mandatory

metrics
  The metrics port. Default is 0 (disabled)

metrics_cache_max_age
  The time to keep a Prometheus (metrics) response in cache. If this value is specified without units,
  it is taken as seconds. Setting this parameter to 0 disables caching. It supports the following units
  as suffixes: 'S' for seconds (default), 'M' for minutes, 'H' for hours, 'D' for days, and 'W' for weeks.
  Default is 0 (disabled)

metrics_cache_max_size
  The maximum amount of data to keep in cache when serving Prometheus responses. Changes require restart.
  This parameter determines the size of memory allocated for the cache even if ``metrics_cache_max_age`` or
  ``metrics`` are disabled. Its value, however, is taken into account only if ``metrics_cache_max_age`` is set
  to a non-zero value. Supports suffixes: ``B`` (bytes), the default if omitted, ``K`` or ``KB`` (kilobytes),

  to set the process title to the full description. Please note that strict and minimal are honored
  only on those systems that do not provide a native way to set the process title (e.g., Linux).
  On other systems, there is no difference between strict and minimal and the assumed behaviour is minimal
