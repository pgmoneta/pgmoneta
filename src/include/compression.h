/**
 * Decompress a file using the appropriate decompression method.

 * This function determines the compression type of the input file by calling
 * `pgmoneta_decompression_file_callback`, and then uses the resulting callback to
 * decompress the file from the `from` path to the `to` path.
 * If no appropriate decompression callback is found, an error is logged.

 * @param from   The source file path, expected to be a compressed file.
 * @param to     The destination file path where the decompressed output will be saved.
 *
 * @return 0 if decompression succeeds, 1 if no matching decompression callback is found or decompression fails.
