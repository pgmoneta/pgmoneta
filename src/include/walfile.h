/**
 * @struct walfile
 * @brief Represents a WAL (Write-Ahead Log) file in a Postgres.
 *
 * WAL files consist of a series of pages, each with a size of 8192 bytes by default.
 * The first page in a WAL file contains a long header (`struct xlog_long_page_header_data`),
 * while all subsequent pages have a standard header (`struct xlog_page_header_data`).
 *
 * Each WAL page holds a collection of records that represent the changes made to the database. These records
 * include both metadata and the actual data that must be recovered in case of a system failure.
 *
 * Fields:
 *   - magic_number: This field indicates the PostgreSQL version that created the WAL file. It is used to validate
 *                   compatibility between the WAL file and the PostgreSQL version handling recovery. This ensures
 *                   that the WAL file can be interpreted correctly by the corresponding PostgreSQL version.
 *   - long_phd: A pointer to the first page header. The first page header is an extended page that contains
 *               the standard page header plus a few more fields.
 *   - page_headers: A deque that holds the headers of each page (excluding the first long page header)
 *                   within the WAL file.
 *                   Each element has a `struct xlog_page_header_data` data type.
 *                   Each page contains metadata about the organization of that page.
 *   - records: A deque that holds the WAL records stored in the WAL file.
 *              Each element has a `struct decoded_xlog_record` data type.
